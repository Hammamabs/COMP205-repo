# AGU-App

The idea of this app is to build a mobile platform that brings the features of UIS, Canvas, and other services into one place. Its name comes from the name of the university "Abdullah GÃ¼l University".

The app will start with a login page. A student can easily login into the app. In case he/she does not have an account, he/she can register him/herself to the system. Moreover, in case of losing the password, students should not worry as the app will send them the recovery password with a click.

Next, we have the homepage where some of the student's information will be displayed. Moreover, with the click of the tasks button, the user will be sent to the tasks page where he/she can set up their daily to-do tasks.

After that, on the courses page, a student can add the course that he/she does not find on the list. This course will be sent to an admin to check the validity of the information submitted.

A great feature of the AGU app is the menu of the canteen. Each day AGU app will display the menu of the canteen. In addition, AGU is capable of displaying the menu for the whole week. Also, each student can add money to the wallet and pay from it. However, that feature is yet to be implemented.

To help foster social relations among students, we included a chat service in our app where anyone registered can talk to anyone.

We included also a forecast, currency exchange, and university map to help students get information as fast as possible.

On the faculty page, the app displays professors' positions, photoes, and titles.

Finally, because we know people have different tastes, the app includes the feature of changing the theme.

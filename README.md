# AGU-App

The idea of this app is to build a mobile platform that brings the features of UIS, Canvas, and other services in on place. Its name comes from the name of the university "Abdullah GÃ¼l Unviersity".

The app will start with login page. A student can easily login in to the app. In case he/she does not have an account, he/she can register him/herself to the system. Moreover, in case of losing the password, students should not worry as the app will send them the recovery password with a click.

Next, we have the homepage where the some of the students information will be displayed. Moreover, on the click of tasks button, the user will be sent to tasks page where he/she can setup their daily to-do tasks.

After that, at the courses page, student can add the course which he/she does not find in the list. This course will be sent to an admin to check the validatiy of the information submitted.

A great feature in AGU app is the menu of the canteen. Each day AGU app will display the menu of the canteen. In addition, AGU is capable of displaying the menu of the whole week. Also, each student can add money to the wallet and pay from it. However, that feature is yet to be implemented.

To help foster social relations among students, we included chat service in our app where anyone registered can talk to anyone.
